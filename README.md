<h2>Adaptive Physically Consistent Neural Networks</h2>

This repository contains a clean and efficient version of Adaptive Physically Consistent Neural Networks (Adapt-PCNN), an improved version of PCNN with better prediction accuracy.
Adapt-PCNN leverages NN with Softplus activation functions, replacing traditional preset and fixed coefficients to reduce trial-and-error costs and increase flexibility. Over a six-month real data center dataset case study, the Adapt-PCNN framework significantly outperformed the traditional PCNN model.
